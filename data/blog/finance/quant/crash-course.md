# RoadMap

---

## 🔹 1. **Math & Statistics Foundations**

You don’t need PhD-level proofs, but you must be fluent enough to implement and reason about models.

- **Probability & Statistics**
  [ ] Distributions (Normal, Lognormal, Poisson, etc.)
  [ ] Moments (mean, variance, skew, kurtosis)
  [ ] Hypothesis testing, p-values, confidence intervals
  [ ] Time series concepts (stationarity, autocorrelation, ARIMA basics)
- **Linear Algebra**
  [ ] Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues/eigenvectors
  [ ] Matrix decompositions (QR, SVD, PCA)
- **Calculus & Optimization**
  [ ] Derivatives (including partials, chain rule, gradient)
  [ ] Integrals, expectations
  [ ] Constrained optimization (Lagrange multipliers, convex optimization)
- **Stochastic Calculus (basic)**
  [ ] Brownian motion, Ito’s lemma, SDEs (at least conceptually)

---

## 🔹 2. **Finance Fundamentals**

Even as an engineer, you need intuition for the data you’ll model:

- **Market Microstructure**
  [ ] Order books, bid-ask spreads, slippage, liquidity
  [ ] Market vs. limit vs. stop orders
- **Equities**
  [ ] Returns (log vs. arithmetic), volatility, Sharpe ratio
- **Options & Derivatives**
  [ ] Payoff diagrams
  [ ] Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho)
  [ ] Black-Scholes-Merton model basics
  [ ] Implied volatility, IV surface/skew
  [ ] Open interest, volume, open_frac, Z-scores (like you’ve been asking)
- **Fixed Income** (light version unless you’re targeting bonds desks)

[ ] Discounting, yield curves, duration/convexity

- **Risk & Portfolio Theory**
  [ ] CAPM, factor models, diversification
  [ ] VaR (Value at Risk), Expected Shortfall

---

## 🔹 3. **Programming & Systems**

This is the **engineer** part — fintech wants people who can build robust systems.

- **Languages**
  [ ] Python (NumPy, pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow optional)
  [ ] C++ (for speed-critical systems, not always required)
  [ ] SQL (data querying)
- **Data Engineering**
  [ ] Working with time series data
  [ ] Streaming data (Kafka, pub/sub systems)
  [ ] APIs for market data (REST, WebSocket)
- **Systems**
  [ ] Linux, Git, Docker
  [ ] Cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure)
  [ ] Parallel/distributed computing basics

---

## 🔹 4. **Machine Learning for Finance**

- **Supervised Learning**
  [ ] Regression (linear, logistic, LASSO, Ridge)
  [ ] Classification (tree models, random forests, XGBoost)
- **Unsupervised Learning**
  [ ] Clustering (k-means, DBSCAN)
  [ ] Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, autoencoders)
- **Deep Learning (optional but useful)**
  [ ] RNN/LSTM for time series
  [ ] Transformers for financial NLP (news/sentiment, SEC filings)
- **Backtesting & Model Validation**
  [ ] Walk-forward testing
  [ ] Cross-validation with time-series splits
  [ ] Avoiding look-ahead bias and data snooping

---

## 🔹 5. **Quant Engineering Specialties**

This is where you “differentiate” depending on the fintech’s focus:

- **Execution & Trading Systems**
  [ ] Market making, arbitrage, smart order routing
- **Risk & Portfolio Analytics**
  [ ] Factor models, stress testing, attribution
- **Alternative Data**
  [ ] News, sentiment, satellite, credit card data
- **Derivatives Analytics**
  [ ] Option pricing models, volatility forecasting

---

## 🔹 6. **Practical Projects (must-have for hiring)**

Build a small **portfolio of projects** to show fintech recruiters:

- [x] Implement a Black-Scholes pricer in Python (with Greeks)
- [ ] Backtest a simple trading strategy (momentum/mean reversion)
- [x] Compute option open_frac and Z-scores from historical data
- [ ] Build a small dashboard (React + Flask or Django) showing live market data
- [ ] Simulate a portfolio and run risk metrics (VaR, Sharpe, drawdown)

---

⚡️ **Crash Course Order (3–6 months plan):**

1. Python + SQL → Data handling, market data APIs
2. Stats + Probability → Confidence intervals, distributions
3. Finance basics → Options, Greeks, portfolio theory
4. Quant tools → Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo, time series models
5. Engineering → Streaming data, cloud systems, APIs
6. Projects → Backtests, dashboards, risk models

👉 Would you like me to **turn this into a structured weekly roadmap (like 12-week crash course)** with study materials, so you have a concrete step-by-step plan?
